Unmodified - when we run command git add --a it will goes to unmodified mode and come to stage area
modified - when we modified some file into stage area it will goes to modeifed mode and stage also modified file.
staged - modified file using this command git add --a it will goes to again staged area.

.gitignore => ignore files in git
------------------------

touch testing.txt => create new file into git directory where your project is present
touch .gitignore => this file ignore basically what files you dont want track
inside .gitignore file you can add => error.log (this is a file name)
after adding above command it will not tracked your newly added files
if you want ignore all log file extentesion then you can write => *.log (it will ignore all log files)

-------------------------
Actual Creiteria
-------------------------

1) git branch => to check how many branch are there.

2) git checkout development => It means First, switch to the 'development' branch

3) git pull origin development => The git pull command is used to fetch changes from a remote repository and integrate them into your current branch.

4) git branch feature-VSO-3116 => create a new branch like this

5) git checkout feature-VSO-3116 => to swith to new branch

6) git branch => again run this command

7) git commit -am "Add dropdownbox to a master page with this VSO" => after coding done commit with descriptive comment.
